This was a pretty straightforward port of a fun game.  I recompiled it
with all optimization on, not that it makes much difference in a game.

This requires EMX.DLL and EMXLIBC.DLL to be in your LIBPATH.  If you
don't have either, then you can get them from ftp-os2.cdrom.com in
os2/2_x/unix/gnu/emx08g/emxrt.zip.
